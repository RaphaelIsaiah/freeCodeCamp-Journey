# Data Visualization Certification

- Data is all around us, but it doesn't mean much without shape or context.

- In the Data Visualization Certification, you'll build **charts**, **graphs**, and **maps** to present different types of data with the D3.js library.

- You'll also learn about **JSON** (_JavaScript Object Notation_), and _how to work with data online using an **API** (Application Programming Interface)_.
