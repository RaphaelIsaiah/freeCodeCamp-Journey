In this mini project, you will get to review JavaScript fundamentals like functions, variables, conditionals and more by building a gradebook app.

This will give you an opportunity to solve small problems and get a better understanding of the basics.

A teacher has finished grading their students' tests and needs your help to calculate the average score for the class.

Complete the getAverage function which takes in an array of test scores and returns the average score.

The average is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the total number of scores.

average = sum of all scores / total number of scores
A couple of function calls have been provided for you so you can test out your code.

Tips

You can use a loop to iterate over the scores array and add up all the scores.
You can use the length property to get the total number of scores.

Initialize Sum: Start by initializing a variable to store the sum of scores.
Loop Through Scores: Use a for loop to iterate through the array of scores and add each score to the sum2.
Calculate Average: Divide the sum by the total number of scores to get the average.
Return Average: Return the calculated average from the function.

This code will correctly calculate the average score for the class when you pass an array of scores to the getAverage function. Remember to test your function with the provided calls to ensure it works as expected.
