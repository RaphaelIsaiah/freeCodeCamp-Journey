Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself. This can reduce a complex problem into simpler sub-problems, until they become straightforward to solve.

In this project, you’ll build a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. You’ll learn the fundamental concepts of recursion, explore the call stack, and build out a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation.

In this project, you'll build a decimal and binary converter and learn about both number systems. You'll also learn about recursion by using it to perform the conversions.

Notice how the project is styled with a mobile first design in the styles.css file.
