# Description

- In computer science, there are fundamental sorting algorithms that all developers should learn. In this number sorter project, you'll learn how to implement and visualize different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort â€“ all with JavaScript.
- This project will help you understand the fundamental concepts behind these algorithms, and how you can apply them to sort numerical data in web applications.

# Notes
- Because you will be writing algorithms that won't immediately have a return value, set a fallback value for array to be an empty array. Here is an example of a function that has a fallback value:
Example Code
const myFunction = (string = "") => {}
- To perform an action on each element in the array, use the method that is meant for iterating over arrays. Use the forEach() method, and pass it an empty callback which takes num and i as the parameters.
