            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of
            the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
            technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web
            page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior
            (JavaScript).
          </p>
          <p>
            "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another,
            either within a single website or between websites. Links are a
            fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet
            and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an
            active participant in the World Wide Web.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for
            display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements"
            such as:
          </p>
          <ul class="right">
            <li><code class="code-inline">&lt;head&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code class="code-inline">&lt;header&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code class="code-inline">&lt;article&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code class="code-inline">&lt;body&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code class="code-inline">&lt;main&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code class="code-inline">&lt;footer&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code class="code-inline">&lt;nav&gt;</code></li>

            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web
            browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as
            complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML
            consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or
            mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a
            certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to
            connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example,
            consider the following line of text:
          </p>
          <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
          <p>
            If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it
            is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph
            (<code class="code-inline">&lt;p&gt;</code>) element:
          </p>
          <code> &lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>

            alt="A sample code snippet explaining the structure of an html element."
          />
          <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
          <ul class="right">
            <li>
              The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this
              example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle
              brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or
              starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of
              the paragraph text.
            </li>
            <li>
              The content: This is the content of the element. In this example,
              it is the paragraph text.
            </li>
            <li>
              The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that
              it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks
              where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a
              common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the
            closing tag.

          <p>
            Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called
            nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could
            wrap the word very in a <code class="code-inline">&lt;strong&gt;</code> element, which
            means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:
          </p>
          <code>
            &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;
            grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;
          </code>
          <p>
            There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above,
            we opened the p element first, then opened the strong element. For
            proper nesting, we should close the strong element first, before
            closing the p.
          </p>

          <p>The following is an example of the wrong way to do nesting:</p>
          <code>
            &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt; very
            grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
          </code>
          <p>
            <b
              >The tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or
              outside one another.</b
            >
            With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to
            guess at your intent. This kind of intent can result in unexpected
            results.

            Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and
            a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is
            typically used to insert/embed something in the document. Such
            elements are called void elements. For example, the
            <code class="code-inline">&lt;img&gt;</code> element embeds an image file onto a page:
          </p>
          <code>
            &lt;img
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"

        <article>
          <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>

          <p>An attribute should have:</p>
          <ul class="right">
            <li>
              A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more
              than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces
              too.)
            </li>
            <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
            <li>
              An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.

            Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next,
            let's examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML
            page:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
              &lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;
                &lt;head&gt;
                  &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
                  &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
                &lt;body&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;This is my page&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/body&gt;
              &lt;/html&gt;
            </code>
          </pre>

          <p>Here we have:</p>
          <ol class="right">
            <li>
              <code class="code-inline">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>: The doctype. When HTML was
              young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of
              rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML.
              <p>
                More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs
                to be included for everything else to work right.
                <code class="code-inline">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> is the shortest string of
                characters that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need
                to know!
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code class="code-inline">&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>: The
              <code class="code-inline">&lt;html&gt;</code> element. This element wraps all the
              content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code class="code-inline">&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code>: The
              <code class="code-inline">&lt;head&gt;</code> element.This element acts as a container
              for everything you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't
              the content the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords
              and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to
              style content, character set declarations, and more. You will
              learn more about this in the next article of the series.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code class="code-inline">&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code>: The
              <code class="code-inline">&lt;meta&gt;</code> element.This element represents metadata
              that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements,
              like<code class="code-inline">&lt;base&gt;</code>, <code class="code-inline">&lt;link&gt;</code>,
              <code class="code-inline">&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code class="code-inline">&lt;style&gt;</code> or
              <code class="code-inline">&lt;title&gt;</code>. The charset attribute specifies the
              character encoding for your document as UTF-8, which includes most
              characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With
              this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might
              contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid
              some problems later.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code class="code-inline">&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code>: The
              <code class="code-inline">&lt;title&gt;</code> element. This sets the title of the
              page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page
              is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page
              when it is bookmarked.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code class="code-inline">&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>: The
              <code class="code-inline">&lt;body&gt;</code> element. This contains all the content
              that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games,
              playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
