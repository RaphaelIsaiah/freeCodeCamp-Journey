_React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces and web applications._

- A fundamental concept in React is the creation of reusable UI components. These components can easily be reused throughout your application.
- React uses a virtual DOM, which improves performance and efficiency.
- React also provides a powerful way to manage the state of your application. State refers to the data that determines how a component renders and behaves. With React, you can easily track and update the state of components, ensuring that the UI reflects the most current data.
- Components are the building blocks of React applications that allow developers to break down complex user interfaces into smaller, manageable pieces, making it easier to develop and maintain large-scale applications.
- The two types of components in React are **functional** and **class** based components. In modern React, developers will use functional components.
- At a higher level, you can think of component like JavaScript functions that return elements describing the UI. This UI is described using JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML but allows you to write UI elements in a more declarative way.
  Let's look at an example of a React component:

  ```
  function Greeting() {
  const name = "John"
  {/_ The result will be Hello John_/}
  return <h1 className="title">Hello {name}</h1>;
  }
  ```

  - In this example, we've defined a component called `Greeting`. The curly braces `{}` inside the `h1` tags enable us to embed JavaScript expressions, allowing us to access the `name` variable within the `h1` element. We are also applying a `className` called `title` to the `h1` element.
    - But why are we using `className` instead of `class` like with regular HTML elements? Well this is because in JavaScript, `class` is a reserved name. So, we need to use `className` instead.
    - We are also using a comment in JSX showing what the result will be. It is important to note that you can use regular comment syntax like this but it needs to be wrapped in curly braces in order for it to work. `{/* Block Comments */}`
    - React treats components with a capital letter as custom components, while elements with lowercase letters are considered built-in HTML elements. If the component name starts with a capital letter, React will treat it as a user-defined component and render it accordingly. This distinction helps React differentiate between native HTML tags and components that you create.
    - To use this Greeting component in our application, we would write something like this: `<Greeting />`

### Working with data in React

- Props, which is short for properties, is the way for Parent components to pass data down to the child component.

  - Props can be of any type: strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or arrays.
  - Letâ€™s update our example from earlier to now accept a `name` prop:

  ```
  function App() {
  return <Greeting name="Jessica" />;
  }

  export default App;

  function Greeting(props) {
  console.log(props);
  return <h1>Hi {props.name}!</h1>;
  }
  ```

  - For the child component called `Greeting` we are now using `props.name` instead of hardcoding the name `"Jessica"`. We are also logging props to the console which is showing as an object. Then inside of the parent App component, we are passing the value to the name prop so it can be passed down to the child. The result will be the same on the screen like earlier, but now we have created a more flexible component.
  - Now we have the ability to reuse the child component several times and pass in different names each time.

  ```
  function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Greeting name="Naomi" />
      <Greeting name="Tom" />
      <Greeting name="Jessica" />
      <Greeting name="Oliver" />
    </>
  );
  }
  ```

  - You can also choose to use object destructuring in the props to make it more readable. Here's how you could rewrite the Greeting component:

  ```
  function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hi {name}!</h1>;
  }
  ```

  - This code achieves the same result but makes it clearer which props the component is expecting to receive.

  - Sometimes, you can have a lot of properties that you have to pass as props. Instead of passing them one by one, you can use the spread operator (...), after converting them to an object.

  - Here is an example of a new child component called DeveloperCard:

  ```
  function DeveloperCard({ name, age, country }) {
  return (
    <div className="developer-card">
      <h1>Developer: {name}</h1>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
      <p>Country: {country}</p>
    </div>
  );
  }
  ```

  - This DeveloperCard component accepts three props: name, age, and country.
  - In the parent App component, we can use the spread syntax to pass all the properties from an object as individual props to the child component.

  ```
  function App() {
  const developerObj = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    country: "USA",
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <DeveloperCard {...developerObj} />
    </div>
  );
  }
  ```

  - This is particularly useful when working with arrays of objects and passing multiple sets of properties to child components. For example, you might have a list of developers where each object in the array has the same structure but represents a different person.

  - Using props in React makes your components more flexible and reusable, allowing you to build more complex UIs. **_However_**, it's important to note that props are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once passed to a component. _If you need to handle user input and modify data, you should use state instead. You'll learn more about managing state in future lectures_.

- Conditional rendering in React allows you to create dynamic user interfaces. It is used to show different content based on certain conditions or states within your application.

  - The most common approaches of using Conditional rendering includes using if statements, the ternary operator, and `logical AND (&&)` operator.
  - The simplest form of conditional rendering uses an if statement. Here is an example:

  ```
  function Greeting({ isLoggedIn }) {
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <h1>Welcome back!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Please sign in</h1>;
  }
  ```

  - In this example, the Greeting component checks the isLoggedIn prop. If it's true, it returns a welcome message, otherwise, it prompts the user to sign in.
  - Here is an example using the Greeting component inside of the parent App component.

  ```
  function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Greeting isLoggedIn={false} />
    </div>
  );
  }
  ```

  - For simpler conditions, the ternary operator (`?`) is often used directly within JSX. It allows for inline conditional rendering, which can make your code more concise:

  ```
  function Greeting({ isLoggedIn }) {
  return <h1>{isLoggedIn ? "Welcome back!" : "Please sign in."}</h1>;
  }
  ```

  - This code achieves the same result as the previous example but in a more compact form. The ternary operator checks isLoggedIn and renders the appropriate message.
  - Another common pattern for conditional rendering is using the `logical AND (&&)` operator. This is particularly useful when you want to render something or nothing based on a condition:

  ```
  function Notification({ message }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {message && <p>{message}</p>}
    </div>
  );
  }
  ```

  In this example, the paragraph element with the `message` is only rendered if the `message` prop is truthy. If `message` is falsy (meaning it is an empty string, `null`, or `undefined`), nothing is rendered to the screen.

- Rendering lists is a fundamental task in React web apps, and is used for displaying data to users. In React, the map() method is used to transform an array of data into an array of JSX elements that can be rendered in the UI.
  - Here is an example of a component called FruitList that displays a list of fruits:
  ```
  function FruitList() {
  const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date'];
  return (
    <ul>
      {fruits.map(fruit => <li>{fruit}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
  }
  ```
  - In this example, the map() function iterates over each item in the fruits array. For each fruit, it creates a new `<li>` element containing the fruit's name. The newly created array of `<li>` elements is then displayed inside the `<ul>` parent tags.
  - However, when rendering lists in React, it is important not to forget the key prop to each element in the list. The key must always be unique and it helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed, which is essential for efficient rendering and updating the list. Let's modify our example to include keys:
  ```
  function FruitList() {
  const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date"];
  return (
    <ul>
      {fruits.map((fruit, index) => (
        <li key={`${fruit}-${index}`}>{fruit}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
  }
  ```
  - In this refactored example, we are creating a unique key for each list item by concatenating the fruit name with its index. This ensures that each list item has a distinct key, which helps React efficiently manage and update the list when items are added, removed, or reordered.
  - React's also allows you to render more complex structures. For instance, you might have an array of objects representing users, each with multiple properties that you want to display:
  ```
  function UserList() {
  const users = [
    { id: "user-001-employee", name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" },
    { id: "user-002-employee", name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com" },
    { id: "user-003-employee", name: "John", email: "john@example.com" },
  ];
  return (
    <div>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <div key={user.id}>
          <h3>{user.name}</h3>
          <p>{user.email}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
  }
  ```
  - In this example, we're creating a more complex JSX structure for each user, displaying both their name and email. We're using the user's id as the key, which is a good practice.
  - In conclusion, rendering lists in React involves converting arrays of data into JSX elements, typically using the map() function.
- In React, inline styles are used to apply CSS styles directly to React elements within your JSX code instead of defining them in separate CSS files.

  - React's approach to inline styles involves using JavaScript objects to define styles, rather than traditional CSS strings. Here is an example of how you can use inline styles for a Button component:

  ```
  function Button({ buttonText }) {
  const defaultStyles = {
    backgroundColor: "#007BFF",
    color: "white",
    border: "none",
    borderRadius: "4px",
    padding: "10px 20px",
    fontSize: "16px",
    fontWeight: "bold",
    cursor: "pointer",
    transition: "background-color 0.3s ease",
  };

  return <button style={defaultStyles}>{buttonText}</button>;
  }
  ```

  - In this example, we define a style object called defaultStyles. We then apply these styles to a button element using the style attribute. React takes care of applying these styles to the element when it renders.
  - A great advantage of inline styles in React is that they support dynamic styling based on a component state or props. For example:

  ```
  function DynamicButton({ isActive }) {
  const buttonStyles = {
    backgroundColor: isActive ? "green" : "red",
    color: "white",
    padding: "10px 15px",
    border: "none",
    cursor: "pointer",
  };

  return <button style={buttonStyles}>Login</button>;
  }
  ```

  - In this example, the button's background color changes based on the isActive prop. This kind of dynamic styling can be powerful for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces.
  - In summary, inline styles in React provide a powerful way to apply and manipulate styles directly within your components. They use JavaScript objects instead of CSS strings, require camelCased property names, and can easily incorporate dynamic values. They're an essential tool in a React developer's toolkit, especially for creating highly customized and interactive user interfaces.

### Notes 2

- There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component. A stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data.

  - The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 `class` syntax. In the following example, `Kitten` extends `React.Component`:

  ```
  class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
  }
  ```

- The ability to set default props is a useful feature in React. The way to override the default props is to explicitly set the prop values for a component.

  ```
  const Items = (props) => {
  return <h1>Current Quantity of Items in Cart: {props.quantity}</h1>
  }

  Items.defaultProps = {
  quantity: 0
  }

  class ShoppingCart extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    { /* Change code below this line */ }
    return <Items quantity={10} />
    { /* Change code above this line */ }
  }
  };

  ```

- React provides useful type-checking features to verify that components receive props of the correct type. For example, your application makes an API call to retrieve data that you expect to be in an array, which is then passed to a component as a prop. You can set `propTypes` on your component to require the data to be of type `array`. This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type.

  - It's considered a best practice to set propTypes when you know the type of a prop ahead of time. You can define a propTypes property for a component in the same way you defined defaultProps. Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type. Here's an example to require the type function for a prop called handleClick:

  ```
    MyComponent.propTypes = { handleClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired }
  ```

  - Example code:

  ```
  const Items = (props) => {
  return <h1>Current Quantity of Items in Cart: {props.quantity}</h1>
  };

  Items.propTypes = {
  quantity: PropTypes.number.isRequired
  }
  ```

  - **Note**: As of React v15.5.0, PropTypes is imported independently from React, like this: import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

- The ES6 class component uses a slightly different convention to access props.

  - Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the `this` keyword. To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with `this`. For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called `data`, you write `{this.props.data}` in JSX.

- _A **stateless functional component** is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX. A **stateless component**, on the other hand, is a class that extends React.Component, but does not use internal state (covered in the next challenge). Finally, a **stateful component** is a class component that does maintain its own internal state._

  - Stateful components referred to simply as components or React components
  - A common pattern is to try to minimize statefulness and to create stateless functional components wherever possible. This helps contain your state management to a specific area of your application. In turn, this improves development and maintenance of your app by making it easier to follow how changes to state affect its behavior.

- One of the most important topics in React is state. State consists of any data your application needs to know about, that can change over time.
  - You create state in a React component by declaring a state property on the component class in its constructor. This initializes the component with state when it is created. The state property must be set to a JavaScript object. Declaring it looks like this: `this.state = {}`
  - You have access to the state object throughout the life of your component. You can update it, render it in your UI, and pass it as props to child components. The state object can be as complex or as simple as you need it to be. Note that you must create a class component by extending React.Component in order to create state like this.
  - Once you define a component's initial state, you can display any part of it in the UI that is rendered. If a component is stateful, it will always have access to the data in `state` in its `render()` method. You can access the data with `this.state`.
  - If you want to access a state value within the `return` of the render method, you have to enclose the value in curly braces.
- `state` is one of the most powerful features of components in React. It allows you to track important data in your app and render a UI in response to changes in this data. If your data changes, your UI will change. React uses what is called a virtual DOM, to keep track of changes behind the scenes. When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that received the data as a prop. React updates the actual DOM, but only where necessary. This means you don't have to worry about changing the DOM. You simply declare what the UI should look like.
- **Note that** if you make a component stateful, no other components are aware of its state. Its state is completely encapsulated, or local to that component, unless you pass state data to a child component as props. This notion of encapsulated state is very important because it allows you to write certain logic, then have that logic contained and isolated in one place in your code.
  ```
  class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
          <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
  };
  ```
  - There is another way to access `state` in a component. In the `render()` method, before the `return` statement, you can write JavaScript directly. For example, you could declare functions, access data from `state` or `props`, perform computations on this data, and so on. Then, you can assign any data to variables, which you have access to in the `return` statement.
  ```
  class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
    const name = this.state.name;
    // Change code above this line
    return (
      <div>
        { /* Change code below this line */}
        <h1>{name}</h1>
        { /* Change code above this line */}
      </div>
    );
  }
  };
  ```
- React provides a method for updating component `state` called `setState`. You call the `setState` method within your component class like so: `this.setState()`, passing in an object with key-value pairs. The keys are your state properties and the values are the updated state data. For instance, if we were storing a `username` in state and wanted to update it, it would look like this:

  ```
  this.setState({
  username: 'Lewis'
  });
  ```

  - React expects you to never modify `state` directly, instead always use `this.setState()` when state changes occur. Also, you should note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve performance. What this means is that state updates through the `setState` method can be asynchronous. There is an alternative syntax for the `setState` method which provides a way around this problem. This is rarely needed but it's good to keep it in mind! **_[Read this React article for further details on how state works in React.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-state-in-react-explained-with-examples/)_**

  ```
  import React from "react";

  class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      visibility: false,
    };
    // Change code below this line
    // Bind the method to this context
    this.toggleVisibility = this.toggleVisibility.bind(this);
    // Change code above this line
  }
  // Change code below this line
  // Define the toggle method
  toggleVisibility() {
    this.setState((state) => ({ visibility: !state.visibility }));
  }
  // Change code above this line
  render() {
    if (this.state.visibility) {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
          <h1>Now you see me!</h1>
        </div>
      );
    } else {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
  }

  export default MyComponent;
  ```

- You can design a more complex stateful component by combining the concepts covered so far. These include initializing state, writing methods that set state, and assigning click handlers to trigger these methods.
- Your application may have more complex interactions between `state` and the rendered UI. For example, form control elements for text input, such as `input` and `textarea`, maintain their own state in the DOM as the user types. With React, you can move this mutable state into a React component's `state`. The user's input becomes part of the application `state`, so React controls the value of that input field. Typically, if you have React components with input fields the user can type into, it will be a controlled input form.
  - This applies to other form elements as well, including the regular HTML `form` element.

### More on Props

- A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the `state` important to your app, that then renders child components. You want these components to have access to some pieces of that `state`, which are passed in as props.
  - For example, maybe you have an App component that renders a Navbar, among other components. In your App, you have state that contains a lot of user information, but the Navbar only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of state to the Navbar component as a prop.
- This pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React.
  - The first is **unidirectional data flow**. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need.
  - The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state.
  - It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another.
  - This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.
- You can pass `state` as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data.
  - You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components.
  - You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under `this.props` in the child component.

### Lifecycle Methods

- React components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component.
  - React components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component.
  - This can be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on. Here is a list of some of the main lifecycle methods:
  ```
  componentWillMount()
  componentDidMount()
  shouldComponentUpdate()
  componentDidUpdate()
  componentWillUnmount()
  ```
  - Note: The componentWillMount Lifecycle method will be deprecated in a future version of 16.X and removed in version 17. Learn more in this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-safely-use-reacts-life-cycles-with-fiber-s-async-rendering-fd4469ebbd8f/)
  - Initialization: Use the constructor or `componentDidMount` for initialization tasks.
  - Rendering Control: Use `shouldComponentUpdate` to optimize performance.
  - Side-Effects: Use `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` for handling side-effects.
  - Cleanup: Use `componentWillUnmount` for cleanup tasks.
- Most web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. If you're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.
  - The best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method componentDidMount().
  - This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to setState() here will trigger a re-rendering of your component.
  - When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.
- The componentDidMount() method is also the best place to attach any event listeners you need to add for specific functionality.
  - React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers. This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.
  - You've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as `onClick()`.
  - React's synthetic event system is great to use for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements. However, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.
- React provides a lifecycle method you can call when child components receive new `state` or `props`, and declare specifically if the components should update or not. The method is `shouldComponentUpdate()`, and it takes `nextProps` and `nextState` as parameters.
  - This method is a useful way to optimize performance. For example, the default behavior is that your component re-renders when it receives new `props`, even if the `props` haven't changed. You can use `shouldComponentUpdate()` to prevent this by comparing the `props`.
  - The method must return a `boolean` value that tells React whether or not to update the component. You can compare the current props (`this.props`) to the next props (`nextProps`) to determine if you need to update or not, and return `true` or `false` accordingly.

### Advanced JavaScript in React Render Method

- You can also write JavaScript directly in your render methods, before the return statement, without inserting it inside of curly braces. This is because it is not yet within the JSX code. When you want to use a variable later in the JSX code inside the return statement, you place the variable name inside curly braces.
- Another application of using JavaScript to control your rendered view is to tie the elements that are rendered to a condition. When the condition is `true`, one view renders. When it's `false`, it's a different view. You can do this with a standard `if/else` statement in the `render()` method of a React component.
- The `if/else` statements worked in the last challenge, but there's a more concise way to achieve the same result. Imagine that you are tracking several conditions in a component and you want different elements to render depending on each of these conditions. If you write a lot of `else if` statements to return slightly different UIs, you may repeat code which leaves room for error. Instead, you can use the `&&` logical operator to perform conditional logic in a more concise way. This is possible because you want to check if a condition is `true`, and if it is, return some markup. Here's an example: `{condition && <p>markup</p>}`
  - If the condition is `true`, the markup will be returned. If the condition is `false`, the operation will immediately return `false` after evaluating the `condition` and return nothing. You can include these statements directly in your JSX and string multiple conditions together by writing `&&` after each one. This allows you to handle more complex conditional logic in your `render()` method without repeating a lot of code.
