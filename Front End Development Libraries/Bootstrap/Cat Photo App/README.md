In the HTML5 and CSS section of freeCodeCamp we built a Cat Photo App. Now let's go back to it. This time, we'll style it using the popular Bootstrap responsive CSS framework.

Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name responsive design.

With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width.

You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>
```

You can use spans to create inline elements. By using the inline span element, you can put several elements on the same line, and even style different parts of the same line differently.

You can use Bootstrap's col-xs-\* classes on form elements, too! This way, our radio buttons will be evenly spread out across the page, regardless of how wide the screen resolution is.
